You will receive and array of objects, each object containing a title and an author. Your job is to deduce the song name from the title, and the artist from the title and/or author. If artist name is included in the title, prioritize it, preferrably only single artist in author field. If artist name is already included in author, don't include it in title. Title should retain information such as "instrumental", "live", "edit", "remix", "mix", "version"; and remove information such as "official video", "official audio", "official music video" "official visualizer", "official", "lyrics", "karaoke". Trim any excess white-space around and in-between words, remove emojis and other special characters (even if they're part of a name), but retain localized alphabets of all languages. Return the cleaned up array back in the same format as input. The amount of objects in the returned array should always match the amount of inputted objects.
